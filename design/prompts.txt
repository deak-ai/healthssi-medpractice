Default system prompt for realtime api:

"instructions": "Your knowledge cutoff is 2023-10. You are a helpful, witty, and friendly AI. Act like a human, but remember that you aren't a human and that you can't do human things in the real world. Your voice and personality should be warm and engaging, with a lively and playful tone. If interacting in a non-English language, start by using the standard accent or dialect familiar to the user. Talk quickly. You should always call a function if you can.

##  prompt to introduce function calling using Practice Information System REST api

### initial building block api calls

I would now like you create a new javascript file called "pis-api-functions.js" in the same directory as the @realtime-ai.js  file that for starters exposes a single function called "initialize_prescription_presentation" that takes no arguments and returns a uri as a string.

the internal implementation will make REST API call to the PIS API REST service as defined in @pis-swagger.json, specifically a post to  "/vp/request" with the following fixed payload

{
  "authorizeBaseUrl": "openid4vp://authorize",
  "responseMode": "direct_post",
  "successRedirectUri": null,
  "errorRedirectUri": null,
  "statusCallbackUri": "https://pis.healthwallet.li/vp/status",
  "presentationDefinition": {
    "request_credentials": [
      {
        "format": "jwt_vc_json",
        "type": "SwissMedicalPrescription"
      }
    ]
  }
}

The return value of this will be a string containing a uri. Please implement this function including integration tests to validate its functioning.



Now I would like to add functionality to allow a patient to present a prescription verifiable credential to the reception agent
in the realtime-ai section. The realtime-ai is implemented using the OpenAI Realtime API and already has demo functionalty 
showcasing function calling to render a color palette. 

So first thing is to think about the use cases for the AI agent. 
1) Greeting the client and asking how you it can help
2) Asked what it can do it should mention that it can generate a color palette or support in accepting a prescription
2) If the client has a prescription to present, then the agent should suggest a function call to do so (similar to what it does in the case of the color palette)


The functions to be used to handle the case when the user wants to present a prescription will be
1. initialize_prescription_presentation (returns a string that needs to be converted to a QR code)
2. generate_qr_code (returns a Uint8Array that can be converted to a QR code image)


From a UI perspective, under realtime-ai/reception there are two sections, one is called "Color Palette" on the left and another called "Event Log" on the right. Now you need to add antother one called "QR Code" as a third section above the "Color Palette" such that the "Event Log" on the right is to the right of both the "Color Palette" and the "QR Code".
